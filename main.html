                        <p>Additionally, it provides expansion slots for peripherals like graphics cards and sound cards. The design and layout of a motherboard can greatly influence system performance and stability. In essence, the motherboard is the heart of a computer, enabling all parts to communicate and work together.</p>

                        <h2>RAM</h2>
                        <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that is used to store data that the computer is currently working with. It is called “random access” because any storage location can be accessed directly. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its contents when the computer is turned off or restarted.</p><br>
                        <p>The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can process at once without slowing down. RAM can be upgraded in many computers, allowing for increased performance. In essence, RAM serves as the “short-term memory” for the computer, holding data that is being actively used.</p>

                        <h2>GPU</h2>
                        <p>A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. A GPU is very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing, and its highly parallel structure makes it more efficient than a general-purpose CPU for algorithms where the processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel.</p><br>
                        <p>In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. In certain CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die. The term GPU was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as “the world’s first GPU”.</p>

                        <p>A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and a Solid State Drive (SSD) are both data storage devices used in computers, but they work in different ways. An HDD stores data on a rotating disk and uses a read/write head on an arm to access data. It retains its data even when powered off.</p><br>
                        <p>On the other hand, an SSD has no moving parts and stores data on interconnected flash-memory chips. SSDs are typically faster, more durable, and more energy-efficient than HDDs, but they are also more expensive. Both HDDs and SSDs can be used for the bulk storage of operating systems, software, and personal files.</p>
